My curiosity was soon cut short as we could not do any practicals since there were no enough Desktops. After a few months a programme was started at Mogra for computer classes and I was among the first ones to enroll. As day went I got more curious of computers and the internet, I opened social media accounts since I wanted so much to be part the village technology has turned the world into. After high school I got a chance to be part of the Jigenge tech club where I learnt so much. I also joined Tunapanda Institute a school of technology and design.

My parents had a humble background. My father was a small scale farmer while my mother was a housewife who took care of us i.e. my siblings and I. As a child I enjoyed growing up in the village as every other children. I cannot forget that first day in school, I was so scared though I wanted it. I remember after school my mother asked how it was and I said I could still not write. She laughed so much and said it was a process. Life was good and nothing seemed wrong until one day when everything changed. Suddenly my father became sick. He could no longer work in the firm so my mother took over. This affected me as a child since my mother no longer had time for us. My older sister took me from school each day since she no longer attended school herself. She had to help our mom with the firm. My father\\u2019s sickness got worse with time and he was admitted to the hospital. My mom had to go there with her and my sister took her role in mylife. It is at this time that floods were witnessed in my village. Floods that swept away houses ours included. That day my sister never came for me in school since the rain was too much I had to wait till very late in the night just to find our house swept away. I spent the night at my mom\\u2019s friend house without sleeping. I was too terrified to sleep. Life after this was so tough especially for my sister who was the oldest. Although I was young I saw what she was going through but I could do nothing. It is at this time when Mogra children\\u2019s Home came into our lives. I was almost 8 years when I joined the center located in Mathare slums then. I adapted first and soon I started enjoying school. Without knowing it I was doing my Primary national exams. I could not believe that I would soon be in high school. My first day in high school was so fun and different from my first day in school. I enjoyed every part of high school until I graduated in 2017. After highschool I was worried about college since I did not get the government requirements to enroll in the public universities but vas, Michael and Brian started computers classes and the Jijenge tech club. I later joined Tunapanda a school of technology and design through the help of Vas.\"))), react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement(_Footer_jsx__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__[\"default\"], null));\n    }\n  }]);\n\n  return Ann;\n}(react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__[\"Component\"]);\n\n\n\n//# sourceURL=webpack:///./src/components/views/Ann.jsx?");
