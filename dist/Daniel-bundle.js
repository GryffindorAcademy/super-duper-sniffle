In 2006 when I was in class one I happen to here those without parents or have a single parent to write their names and submitted to the school office, I submitted my name and after a period of a year we were told that we will be taken to school where we could be give support and shown how to read and provided with our needs. I came in Mogra in the year 2007 when I was in class two, I have been in Mogra Children\\u2019s Home 11 years where I have overcome all the challenges and the desire to see my sisters and brother which have been a challenge in my life. I am 19 years old. Regardless of the desiring the love of a parent and someone to show me the way I came to Mogra I am now educated from the pre-school to high school. In mogra I have managed to develop skills, talent and activities, I like football, skating on highways, dancing, interacting with friends, making new friends and showing them love that I have been shown in Mogra. In Mogra I have it have been at least good since I could not lack something to eat, someone to call a mum and dad, friends, someone to show me love of a parenthood, where living in Mogra enabled me understand myself and respect others in the society. In Mogra I have gone through many challenges but tried to move on in life until present. I have learnt a lot in Mogra living with people in unity, sharing ideas, speaking out and been a God fearing person. Since I was a small kid I have desired to be a designer. I like drawing, painting pictures and commenting on what have been done and improve it myself That why I decided instead of stressing my mind I better take interior design and make my life better with a career that would make me free, I came to understand that what you do out of you heart you perfect better. My current steps to achieve my goal is only on books since out of my knowledge that is in me I believe that when I get to school it will shine out to the whole world and I can make the world colourful. What rings in my mind is that a journey of a thousand miles start with a single step, for I to shine out one have to build foundation for something to be stable, I am supposed to start with the foundation in architecture that I can move with my career. The most that I need so to achieve my career is a whole of requirements that I hope that in one time to come I will be able to have, not only that but encouragement for I press on so I can see not only those in big homes can attend to better colleges and universities, Support and someone to take me to school and support me and buy me the school requirements.\"\n            )\n          )\n        ),\n        _react2.default.createElement(\n          \"footer\",\n          null,\n          _react2.default.createElement(_Footer2.default, null)\n        )\n      );\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: \"__reactstandin__regenerateByEval\",\n    // @ts-ignore\n    value: function __reactstandin__regenerateByEval(key, code) {\n      // @ts-ignore\n      this[key] = eval(code);\n    }\n  }]);\n  return Daniel;\n}(_react.Component);\n\nvar _default = Daniel;\nexports.default = _default;\n;\n\n(function () {\n  var reactHotLoader = __webpack_require__(/*! react-hot-loader */ \"./node_modules/react-hot-loader/index.js\").default;\n\n  var leaveModule = __webpack_require__(/*! react-hot-loader */ \"./node_modules/react-hot-loader/index.js\").leaveModule;\n\n  if (!reactHotLoader) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  reactHotLoader.register(Daniel, \"Daniel\", \"/Users/isabellabeltran/Code/super-duper-sniffle/src/components/Daniel.jsx\");\n  reactHotLoader.register(_default, \"default\", \"/Users/isabellabeltran/Code/super-duper-sniffle/src/components/Daniel.jsx\");\n  leaveModule(module);\n})();\n\n;\n/* WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */}.call(this, __webpack_require__(/*! ./../../node_modules/webpack/buildin/module.js */ \"./node_modules/webpack/buildin/module.js\")(module)))\n\n//# sourceURL=webpack:///./src/components/Daniel.jsx?");
