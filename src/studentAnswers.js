  high school. I was introduced to computers and I liked it so
  much. I could not get enough of what they could do and so I
  could wait the whole day for the classes. My curiosity was soon
  cut short as we could not do any practicals since there were no
  enough Desktops. After a few months a programme was started at
  Mogra for computer classes and I was among the first ones to
  enroll. As day went I got more curious of computers and the
  internet, I opened social media accounts since I wanted so much
  to be part the village technology has turned the world into.
  After high school I got a chance to be part of the Jigenge tech
  club where I learnt so much. I also joined Tunapanda Institute a
  school of technology and design. While there I did so much with
  computers(making mobile application, website and animating). Am
  still curious of what else the computers can do.`,

  using wordpress. My team and I made a website for
  Entrepreneurship content. We used the intent to search for the
  information and I could not believe what we came up with. The
  website was amazing`,
  story: `I was born in a small village called Kamanzi in Machakos County.
  My parents had a humble background. My father was a small scale
  farmer while my mother was a housewife who took care of us i.e.
  my siblings and I. As a child I enjoyed growing up in the
  village as every other children. I cannot forget that first day
  in school, I was so scared though I wanted it. I remember after
  school my mother asked how it was and I said I could still not
  write. She laughed so much and said it was a process. Life was
  good and nothing seemed wrong until one day when everything
  changed. Suddenly my father became sick. He could no longer work
  in the firm so my mother took over. This affected me as a child
  since my mother no longer had time for us. My older sister took
  me from school each day since she no longer attended school
  herself. She had to help our mom with the firm. My father’s
  sickness got worse with time and he was admitted to the
  hospital. My mom had to go there with her and my sister took her
  role in mylife. It is at this time that floods were witnessed in
  my village. Floods that swept away houses ours included. That
  day my sister never came for me in school since the rain was too
  much I had to wait till very late in the night just to find our
  house swept away. I spent the night at my mom’s friend house
  without sleeping. I was too terrified to sleep. Life after this
  was so tough especially for my sister who was the oldest.
  Although I was young I saw what she was going through but I
  could do nothing. It is at this time when Mogra children’s Home
  came into our lives. I was almost 8 years when I joined the
  center located in Mathare slums then. I adapted first and soon I
  started enjoying school. Without knowing it I was doing my
  Primary national exams. I could not believe that I would soon be
  in high school. My first day in high school was so fun and
  different from my first day in school. I enjoyed every part of
  high school until I graduated in 2017. After highschool I was
  worried about college since I did not get the government
  requirements to enroll in the public universities but vas,
  Michael and Brian started computers classes and the Jijenge tech
  club. I later joined Tunapanda a school of technology and design
  through the help of Vas.`

  story: ` My name is Mwaura Daniel Munyoro, The son of Simon Mwaura
  Wangiha and the late Jacinter Gathoni Mwaura, the the second
  born of Mwaura family of five kids, I was born in 1999 in a
  small village called Subukia in Nakuru county, before I came to
  Mogra Children’s I lived with my grandmother in Subukia, where
  she was not able to pay for school fees of five kids, provide
  shelter, clothing and the love of a mother. In 2006 when I was
  in class one I happen to here those without parents or have a
  single parent to write their names and submitted to the school
  office, I submitted my name and after a period of a year we were
  told that we will be taken to school where we could be give
  support and shown how to read and provided with our needs. I
  came in Mogra in the year 2007 when I was in class two, I have
  been in Mogra Children’s Home 11 years where I have overcome all
  the challenges and the desire to see my sisters and brother
  which have been a challenge in my life. I am 19 years old.
  Regardless of the desiring the love of a parent and someone to
  show me the way I came to Mogra I am now educated from the
  pre-school to high school. In mogra I have managed to develop
  skills, talent and activities, I like football, skating on
  highways, dancing, interacting with friends, making new friends
  and showing them love that I have been shown in Mogra. In Mogra
  I have it have been at least good since I could not lack
  something to eat, someone to call a mum and dad, friends,
  someone to show me love of a parenthood, where living in Mogra
  enabled me understand myself and respect others in the society.
  In Mogra I have gone through many challenges but tried to move
  on in life until present. I have learnt a lot in Mogra living
  with people in unity, sharing ideas, speaking out and been a God
  fearing person. Since I was a small kid I have desired to be a
  designer. I like drawing, painting pictures and commenting on
  what have been done and improve it myself That why I decided
  instead of stressing my mind I better take interior design and
  make my life better with a career that would make me free, I
  came to understand that what you do out of you heart you perfect
  better. My current steps to achieve my goal is only on books
  since out of my knowledge that is in me I believe that when I
  get to school it will shine out to the whole world and I can
  make the world colourful. What rings in my mind is that a
  journey of a thousand miles start with a single step, for I to
  shine out one have to build foundation for something to be
  stable, I am supposed to start with the foundation in
  architecture that I can move with my career. The most that I
  need so to achieve my career is a whole of requirements that I
  hope that in one time to come I will be able to have, not only
  that but encouragement for I press on so I can see not only
  those in big homes can attend to better colleges and
  universities, Support and someone to take me to school and
  support me and buy me the school requirements.`

  story: `I was born in a family of six members. My father, mother and my
  three sisters. I lived with my family at a place called Kangundo
  in Machakos County. I lived with my parents till when I was
  one-year-old. My parents were not that able since no one was
  working. I lived a life full of challenges till one day I got
  someone to get me a sponsor who sponsored me to join school. The
  person who sponsored me said that I should join Mogra Children’s
  home so that I can be given full support. Till then I got
  separated with my parents. Life was a little hard without my
  parents close to me but I had to accept the situation since I
  needed the education. I was brought to Mogra Children’s home
  till I was in class six that is when my dad came and took me by
  force from school to go back with him. I was still so young so I
  had no option but follow his order since he was my dad. Life was
  not that easy with my dad, since when I got home my mum was no
  longer there and dad wanted me to stay with him. After staying
  with my dad for few days then my dad decided, since my mum was
  not there he got married again. My step mother started
  mistreating me and I did all the home chores and was never given
  any food at all, I could fetch a lot of water from a far
  distance carrying a twenty liters can as young as I was. I felt
  like it was the end of the world without my mum, since life
  became hard every single day passed my life became a nightmare
  with no mum to share my problems with. Going to school was not
  that easy because every day I was send home for school fees. My
  dad never cared nor did he love me he could just tell me to go
  back to school without school fees. The school director saw that
  whenever I was send home regardless how many times a day, I
  could still come back to school so sometimes he could have mercy
  on me and allow me to stay in class for some few days before he
  could send me back again. It was like that till one day the
  teachers saw that I was determined to study that they helped me
  till I was done with primary education. I struggled until I
  finished class eight with no food nor using anything from my dad
  since he and my step mum decided to treat me like a slave. I
  could eat food from neighbor’s and clothes I could be given by
  my friends. When I finished class eight I passed very well
  despite the challenges. My dad refused to take me to school and
  I had to do something since my life could be useless without me
  going to school. I had Mama Hannah number so decided to call her
  and explain all my problems to her. At first she could not
  believe me since my dad had stolen me from the home without her
  knowing. I pleaded with her to at least let me finish my
  education since it was not my will or my happiness for my dad to
  take me away. She is a kind, loving and God fearing woman, she
  listened to me and I was then allowed to come back home since
  this was the only home I knew since I understood who I was.
  Since I was allowed to stay in the home my life has always being
  great. Since that day I was brought back to this home no family
  member has ever come see me not even my dad. My mum, I don’t
  know where she is I have never heard any stories of my mum since
  I was one-year-old that’s the only time and last time I saw my
  mum. Hope one day I could hear from her even if it’s in heaven.
  My life is the most wonderful thing since I have many sisters
  and brothers who we take care of each other. Our mum and Dad in
  this home are the most wonderful people who have never had in
  this world. They took us when we needed them the most and showed
  us all the love in this world. Am now a teenager who knows what
  life is thanks to our mum Hannah who has always being there and
  our dad Njoroge. Life in Mogra Children’s home is the best. Now
  am done with high school now waiting to join college as I
  volunteer in the children home with the small babies. Am just
  praying hard to get someone to take me to college.`

  story: `I was born in 2000, the year that everybody believed that there
  would be a rapture. I was born in Nairobi County but later on my
  parents (Mr. and Mrs. Njoroge) migrated to Kiambu County, Lari sub
  county in a village known as Githirioni. Being a young and
  unemployed couple, my parents started off in a poor state. We
  lived in a single room made of iron sheet and the bedroom and the
  sitting room were divided by a curtain. Each night, I would spend
  at my grandmother’s house so as to give my parents some privacy. I
  spent most of my childhood with my paternal grandmother as my
  parents were busy working manually so as to at least put a meal on
  the table. When I was two, my mother gave birth to a bouncing baby
  boy and I was thrilled each minute I saw his little cute face and
  touch his smooth skin. I bragged about him to my friends and I
  would not let anyone touch him. By this time, my parents had
  worked so hard and bought a cow so milk was not a problem. At
  four, I started nursery school at Salome academy and using the
  money my parents got from the sale of milk and doing extra jobs,
  my fees was paid and our basic needs met. After one year in
  nursery school, my high IQ allowed me to move to the next class
  but my mother argued that I was too young to proceed. However, my
  nursery school teacher told her that I was good to go to class one
  since I was smart and my mother had no option but to give in. I
  learnt class one in the same school but transferred to another
  school, a public one (Nyamweru Primary school), when I was in
  class two (2006). Life had become a bit difficult for my parents
  since my youngest sibling had been born, responsibilities
  increased and so fees for a private school could not be afforded.
  Thanks to my parents’ hard work and determination to give us a
  better life, in 2009 we moved into a new and beautiful house that
  they had built. Most villagers were in for a rude shock since they
  never thought that my poor parents could make such progress in
  life. My mother is gifted in farming and so she would cultivate
  different crops and get some money by selling them. On the other
  hand, my daddy worked at a petrol station and made some good money
  that at least met our basic needs. Life ran smoothly until one day
  the unexpected happened. Things suddenly changed. I remember
  vividly as though it happened just the previous minute. I was in
  class 7 (2011) and this day I had just completed doing my
  assignment and had just laid on my bed when my father came and
  banged the door, something he had never done before. I sensed that
  something was wrong. My mother went and opened to welcome him but
  she was met by a slap, then a filthy stench of alcohol filled the
  house. My father was drunk! He bit up my mother who escaped to my
  grandmother’s house bruised. I wept uncontrollably. He no longer
  spent time with us and each time he came home, he was ever drunk
  and would bit up my mother. In 2012, when I finished doing my
  national exam, my mother had had enough of it and she left with
  me, leaving my siblings. I wept but nothing could change. The
  water had already been spilt. Despite of my parents’ frequent
  fighting, I at least managed to score 302 marks in that year’s
  KCPE and received an admission letter from Kijabe Girls Secondary
  school. Since my parents had separated and my mummy had no money
  or any source of income, I could not go. She left me with my
  maternal grandmother and went in search of a job as I was enrolled
  in a day school (Mutuma Trinity Secondary school) that is not so
  popular. This was in 2013. She was employed in Mogra Children Home
  and I rarely saw her. I missed her a lot BUT missed my siblings
  even more and each day I hoped and prayed that my mother could one
  day go for them and save them from the ill treatment of the
  stepmother. In 2015, my prayers were answered and she went for
  them and brought them to Mogra Children Home. At Mutuma Trinity
  Secondary School, I did my level best and never got anything below
  a C plain in each exam. In 2014, I was actually elected as a
  prefect where I served until 2016, my final year in secondary
  school. I did the KCSE and had very high hopes, little did I know
  that the marking and grading systems had been changed and so I
  only managed to score a D+. I could not believe this and I really
  wailed. I thought myself as the greatest failure who has ever
  lived. Since I could not face the shame and disgrace, I decided to
  repeat form four (grade 12) and in 2017, I moved to Mogra Children
  Home, where my mother works and thanks to the director, she gave
  me a second chance to prove my potential. I promised myself that I
  would do my level best. I spent sleepless night revising and lucky
  enough, I scored a C plain in the second KCSE attempt. I was
  thrilled. I had improved by 2 points. After KCSE, I received a
  phone and a personal laptop from Vas who was initiating the
  Jijenge programme; a programme that involves teaching computer
  studies. Early January 2018, I and some fellow students started
  the computer studies with Vas, Michael and Bryan as our teachers.
  We had three lessons each week, a day with each teacher. I also
  worked as a childcare specialist where I took care of children
  aged between 4 to 14 years, managed their transportation to and
  from school by bus and even planned their meal I also reported to
  the director any arising issues, something that has left me
  trusted up-to-date.`

  Jairo Omondi decided to join the street urchins where they could
  go around the street of Nairobi collecting scrap metals, selling
  them so that he could provide for the whole family. He strived for
  some years till my mother got a job as a house wife at East Leigh
  in Nairobi. She later on took us to school with the little amount
  she could manage to get as well as providing for the family. My
  mother’s new job brought smile in everyone’s face in our family
  until she felt sick. She was admitted to Kenyatta National
  Hospital and after being diagnosed, she was found to be suffering
  from Tuberculosis (TB). Her sickness worsened and later on she
  passed on. My father’s death come over after a few months out of
  depression. My parent’s death, life worsened more than it was
  before they were death, so my brother decided to leave his studies
  and back to the duty in the street so that he could provide for
  us. Surely God is never asleep. An angel was sent from nowhere.
  Reverent[U1] Hannah took us from the slum and admitted us to Mogra
  Children Home as well as taking us to school. She brought back our
  joy and placed a new smile on our faces. I did my primary level
  well, went to secondary school and now am glad have joined a
  university and believing for a brighter future. Am also looking
  forward to support the younger ones just as someone else did to
